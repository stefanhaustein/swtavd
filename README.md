# swtavd
SWT renderer for Android Vector Drawables

Not very well tested, just with a bunch of vector assets included in Android Studio -- please file an issue and attach the icon if something doesn't work. 

Note: The gradle build doesn't seem to work properly, probably because of this issue: https://github.com/stefanhaustein/swtavd/blob/master/src/main/java/org/kobjects/swt/avd/AndroidVectorDrawable.java 

Given that the implementation is just one file, a temporaray workaround might be to just copy it.
